# Logic-locking
I was selected to be a Winter Research Intern at IIT Guwahati where I worked on principles of different logic locking techniques as well as defence mechanisms.<br>

Currently, I have uploaded few research papers of researchers from New York university, PES University, IIT kanpur, University of Central Florida, University of Cincinnati, North Carolina State University, Virginia Tech and George Mason University which I did go through for better understanding at the beginning and obviously before starting with practical experience and implementation.
